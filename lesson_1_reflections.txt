How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped in that I didn't have to trawl through lines of code to see what was
different.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Whenever I make a change that breaks the program I could go back a step, if it's
proving too complicated to suss out manually.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Sometimes it's best, for organizational purposes, if your code is split up into
multiple files; sometimes it has to be in multiple files.
===
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You know you can revert back easily to a state where the program is working, so
you're free to branch out in new commits.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version control, and keeping an up to date GitHub account so that all future
employers will be like: "Wow! what a nice GitHub".
