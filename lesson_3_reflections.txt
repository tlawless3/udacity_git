When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm going to be working from multiple computers without the ability to share files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You could end up forking your code when you didn't need to, or make
    some other aggregious mistake, and you would mess up all of your 
    backups if it automatically updated your remote repository. Also 
    I'd imagine that's a lot mroe strain on GitHub's servers.
